                Communities start with someone who has experience managing a
                fundraiser on the M-Changa platform. This person becomes the
                Community Coordinator and their role is to invite and manage
                existing or new M-Changa fundraisers together as a Community.

                    The Community Page is a public page providing information
                    about the Community and the individual fundraisers that make
                    up the Community. Donors may choose to donate to individual
                    fundraisers in the Community or to donate to the Community
                    Pot.

                    The Community Pot is a mechanism that allows the Community
                    Coordinator to accept funds to support the Community as a
                    whole and distribute the funds to the Fundraisers in the
                    Community based on various Community rules. For example, a
                    Community Fundraiser may decide to re-distribute excess
                    funds raised in one Fundraiser that has met their goals to
                    another Fundraiser that is struggling to meet their goals.
